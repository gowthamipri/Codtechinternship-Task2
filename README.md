->Overview of the Weather Forecast App Project

-Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information for any city around the world. By integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API, the app fetches current weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short weather description.
-Features
1. City-Based Weather Search: Users can input a city name to get the weather details for that location.
2. Real-Time Weather Updates: Fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap's API.
3. Comprehensive Weather Details:
   - Current temperature (in Â°C)
   - Weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
   - Humidity level
   - Wind speed
4. Responsive and Intuitive Design:
   - A clean and minimalistic user interface.
   - Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
5. Error Handling:
   - Alerts users if the city name is invalid or not found.
   - Displays a helpful error message if there is a problem with the API request.
-Technologies Used
1. Frontend
   - HTML: To structure the web page.
   - CSS: For styling the app and creating a responsive design.
   - JavaScript: To add interactivity and handle API calls.
2. API:
   - OpenWeatherMap API: Provides real-time weather data for the specified city.
-->How It Works???
1. Users enter the name of a city in the input box and click the "Get Weather" button.
2. The app dynamically constructs an API request to OpenWeatherMap using the entered city name and a pre-configured API key.
3. The app fetches weather details (like temperature, description, and wind speed) and displays them in a well-organized format.
4. If the entered city name is invalid, an alert notifies the user.
->Learning Objectives
- Understand how to fetch and display data from a third-party API.
- Learn to build dynamic web applications using vanilla JavaScript.
- Improve UI/UX design skills with responsive layouts using CSS.
- Handle errors gracefully in a web application.

This project is an excellent starting point for developers looking to explore API integration and build interactive web applications. It can be extended further by adding features like a 5-day weather forecast, location-based weather detection, or advanced styling frameworks like Bootstrap.
